Python Banking App with GUI
This is a simple Python-based banking application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the tkinter library. The app allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. The GUI enhances the user experience with interactive features and vibrant color schemes.

Features:
Show Balance: View the current balance in your account.
Deposit: Add funds to your balance with a user-friendly input prompt.
Withdraw: Withdraw funds, with error handling for insufficient balance or invalid amounts.
Exit: Close the application gracefully.
Technologies Used:
Python 3
tkinter (for GUI)
How It Works:
When you run the program, a window appears with buttons for depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking the balance.
Users interact with simple dialog boxes to enter amounts for deposits or withdrawals.
The balance is dynamically updated and displayed at the top of the window.
If an invalid action is performed (e.g., withdrawing more than the current balance), the program will show an error message.
